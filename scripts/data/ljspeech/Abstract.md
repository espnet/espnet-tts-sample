This is tts demo of The LJ Speech Dataset [0].

### tts1 recipe

`tts1` recipe is based on Tacotron2 [1] (spectrogram prediction network) w/o WaveNet.
Tacotron2 generates log mel-filter bank from text and then converts it to linear spectrogram using inverse mel-basis.
Finally, phase components are recovered with Griffin-Lim.

(2019/06/16) we also support TTS-Transformer [3].  
(2019/06/17) we also support Feed-forward Transformer [4].  

### tts2 recipe

`tts2` recipe is based on Tacotron2's spectrogram prediction network [1] and Tacotron's CBHG module [2].
Instead of using inverse mel-basis, CBHG module is used to convert log mel-filter bank to linear spectrogram.
The recovery of the phase components is the same as `tts1`.
